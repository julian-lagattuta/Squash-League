# Squash-League

I was hired by the Fairfield County Squash League to create a game schedule generator. I invented my own algorithm to optimize the game schedule such that teams maximize the number of games they play, without playing too many games in a short period of time, and while balancing game locations, taking into account each teamâ€™s location and other constraints. The algorithm can make updates to the schedule if a team changes its constraints mid-season.
