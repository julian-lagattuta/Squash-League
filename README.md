# Squash League Scheduler

I was hired by the FairWest Public School Squash Association to create a game scheduler. I invented an algorithm to maximize the games each team plays, while optimizing game frequency for each team while taking into account each team's constraints, such as when and where each team can play. Updates the schedule if a team changes its constraints mid-season.
